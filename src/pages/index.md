          Today's technology allows you to deploy your application with all the
          necessary configuration with just a few steps. We'll use Azure Static
          Web Apps, Functions, and Cosmos DB to transform your wonderful Angular
          front-end to a full-featured application that you can serve to your
          audience right away.

          The new service by Azure takes care of all the necessary details of
          deployment. It takes your project straight from GitHub, adds SSL
          certificate, provides user management (authentication and
          authorization) out of the box, enables seamless integration with your
          API, and more.

        title_align: left
        content: >
          During the five days we'll meet every day for a 2-hour workshop
          (11:00-13:00 CEST), where we'll connect a pre-made Angular application
          to Azure, step by step. First we'll deploy it on Static Web Apps, then
          add an API, connect to Cosmos DB, use authentication and
          authorization, and configure routing. The workshops will be recorded.


          After the workshop we'll have Q\&A (13:30-14:30 CEST) where Shmuela
          will take a look at your projects and help you both with Angular and
          Azure. Several mentors will be available throughout the week for
          additional assistance. Additional relevant content will be provided,
          such as video tutorials and Learn Modules.


          About a week later we'll meet again to present our applications.

      - title: Participating
        title_align: left
        content: >
          The workshops are free for women, and designed for developers who have
          some experience with Angular. It can be suitable also for developers
          with experience with other front-end frameworks such as React or Vue.
          We will use Angular-specific methods for HTTP requests and routing,
          but you can implicate on your preferable framework.


          You may or may not have experience with back end or other Cloud
          services (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud and others). We will go through the
          process and ideas behind deployment and Serverless architecture.


          Shortly after applying to HackaLearn we will inform you whether you
          have the necessary prerequisites to attend. We may suggest other
          learning programs or, if you seem to have enough experience, invite
          you as a mentor.
        content_align: left
      - title: The Challenge
        title_align: left
        content: >
          The challenge consists of three parts, for which you'll be eligible
          for an Azure Hero Badge:


          1.  Deploying your own application to Static Web Apps,


          2.  Completing the Learn Modules provided in the Cloud Skills
          Challenge,


          3.  Sharing a post where you tell about your experience.
        content_align: left
      - title: Details
        title_align: left
        content: >
          Participation is free of charge. In addition, Azure is free for
          (generous) limited use.


          The workshops will be held in English. Depending on the mentors'
          capabilities, we may support you in other languages during consultancy
          time.


          If you're not able to attend this time, or you don't belong to an
          underrepresented group in tech, you may join the next round of
          HackaLearn which will be open to all, on August 1-5.
