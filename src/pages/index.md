        content: "### Transform your Angular App to a Full-Featured Web App\n\nYou have wonderful ideas, and you use Angular to create beautiful applications with meaningful content and user engagement. But you've always wondered how hard it would be to push your project to production. With my guidance you'll be able to deploy and add essential features to your web application in five days.\n\nI don't want to fool you, no one becomes a full-stack expert in only five days. The purpose of HackaLearn is to get you started in the right direction, with personal support and a clear route for the next steps. I believe in learning by doing, especially when it comes to technical skills. And, like I'm excited about Angular, I'm also excited about the new Serverless offerings on Azure and other Cloud providers which simplify the process for us developers.\n\n### Make Great Use of your Summer Vacation\n\nI truly hope that you have time to relax during the summer vacation. If you'll have a few hours every now and then to learn something new, expand your portfolio, and take your ideas to the next level - don't miss up on this opportunity.\n\nMy own summer vacation is a long one with holidays throughout September. As an ngMom I'll be spending it with my two little adorable ngBoys, and their ReactDad \U0001F609\_I am truly grateful for my full time job as a Cloud Advocate at Microsoft which enables me to use the last few weeks before my vacation to bring my knowledge and experience and personally inspire and motivate ngGirls all around the world.\n\n![](/images/ngGirls_learn.png)\n"

      - content: >
          Today's technology allows you to deploy your application with all the
          necessary configuration with just a few steps. We'll use Azure Static
          Web Apps, Functions, and Cosmos DB to transform your wonderful Angular
          front-end to a full-featured application that you can serve to your
          audience right away.

        content: >
          ## Static Web Apps


          The new service by Azure takes care of all the necessary details of
          deployment. It takes your project straight from GitHub, adds SSL
          certificate, provides user management (authentication and
          authorization) out of the box, enables seamless integration with your
          API, and more.

          ## Azure Functions


          Write backend functions that connect your front end with backend
          services such as DB, or perform heavy or confidential logic in a
          secure environment. These functions can be triggered by HTTP requests,
          database actions, and more.

          With this NoSQL database your application can scale and grow without
          the need to to update your schema. Cosmos DB comes with different
          "flavors" (APIs) that let you use a DB language you're familiar with.

        title_align: left
        content: >
          During the five days we'll meet every day for a 2-hour workshop
          (11:00-13:00 CEST), where we'll connect a pre-made Angular application
          to Azure, step by step. First we'll deploy it on Static Web Apps, then
          add an API, connect to Cosmos DB, use authentication and
          authorization, and configure routing. The workshops will be recorded.


          After the workshop we'll have Q\&A (13:30-14:30 CEST) where Shmuela
          will take a look at your projects and help you both with Angular and
          Azure. Several mentors will be available throughout the week for
          additional assistance. Additional relevant content will be provided,
          such as video tutorials and Learn Modules.


          About a week later we'll meet again to present our applications.
        content_align: left
      - title: Participating
        title_align: left
        content: >
          The workshops are free for women, and designed for developers who have
          some experience with Angular. It can be suitable also for developers
          with experience with other front-end frameworks such as React or Vue.
          We will use Angular-specific methods for HTTP requests and routing,
          but you can implicate on your preferable framework.


          You may or may not have experience with back end or other Cloud
          services (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud and others). We will go through the
          process and ideas behind deployment and Serverless architecture.


          Shortly after applying to HackaLearn we will inform you whether you
          have the necessary prerequisites to attend. We may suggest other
          learning programs or, if you seem to have enough experience, invite
          you as a mentor.
        content_align: left
      - title: The Challenge
        title_align: left
        content: >
          The challenge consists of three parts, for which you'll be eligible
          for an Azure Hero Badge:


          1.  Deploying your own application to Static Web Apps,


          2.  Completing the Learn Modules provided in the Cloud Skills
          Challenge,


          3.  Sharing a post where you tell about your experience.

        content: >
          Participation is free of charge. In addition, Azure is free for
          (generous) limited use.


          The workshops will be held in English. Depending on the mentors'
          capabilities, we may support you in other languages during consultancy
          time.


          If you're not able to attend this time, or you don't belong to an
          underrepresented group in tech, you may join the [next round of

          Hi! I'm Shmuela. I’m a proud ngMom of two little ngBoys. Besides that,
          I'm a front-end developer and consultant, the founder of ngGirls,
          working as a Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. I'm a Google
          Developer Expert in Angular and Web Technologies. My passion for
          teaching, which had been expressed in the past as a guide in science
          museums and TA in university, has been integrated in my journey of
          becoming a developer.


          During my masters degree I started loving programming. I also realized
          how important the Web is - browsers and web apps have become the most
          used programs on our computers and phones. While attending several
          meetups to explore JavaScript frameworks I fell in love with
          AngularJS. I took a course and started working as a front-end
          consultant, while teaching developers in meetups and conferences.

I wanted to inspire specifically women, as I was inspired and motivated by programs such as Django Girls, Rails Girls and Google CodeF. I founded ngGirls and organized the first workshop with the help of many people in the community. It was a great success and excitement. I kept on collaborating with conferences and tech companies to organize more workshops, as the ngGirls team grew with passionate volunteers.\_\n\nToday I enjoy a fulfilling position at Microsoft, getting to do everything I love: coding web apps, teaching and inspiring beginners and advanced programmers, and maintaining a warm, loving home for my family.\n"
